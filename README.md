# üí° Installation & Getting Started
1) Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Zhuolin0212/Connect-Your-Neurons.git
```
2) Execute ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all necessary libraries.
3) Open Flask_App folder and execute ```set FLASK_APP=main.py``` command in cmd if you are using windows or in bash shell if you are using either Linux or Mac.
4) Execute ```flask run``` command in cmd if you are using windows or in bash shell if you are using either Linux or Mac to start the application at ```http://localhost:5000```.
# ‚ùì What is Connect Your Neurons?
Connect Your Neurons cen help users rapidly prototype for neural networks with GUI. It also can help deep learning user easily and efficiently convert trained models between frameworks.

# üôã Why jump to us
If you jump into our group project, you will enhance your deep network knowledge and learn more about neural network framework. This intermediate app will enable beginners of deep learning to better and more intuitive understanding of neural networks. And it make it easy to add new deep learning frameworks for users. 


# üì¢ Disclosure

We know that some of you may not have the necessary knowledge to build this software, but we can assure you that you just require some basic fundamental skills like python and machine learning to work on this project and build the software. Plus, you will learn something new and cool.

# üîÆ Features For Our Application
- Generate an architecture in keras, pytorch etc based on parameters provided
- Convert a keras architecture to pytorch & vice versa
- Convert a trained keras model to pytorch and vice versa by providing an architecture file and weights.
- Given parameters and architecture train a model on cloud and ship back the architecture & weights to the customer.
